# Questionnaire Builder

This Java application is a survey and test builder that allows users to create, modify, save, take, and tabulate surveys and tests. With tests, users can set the correct answer for each question. There are many different types of questions to choose from: essay, matching, multiple choice, short answer, true/false, correct date.

After saving a questionnaire, it is stored in the following directory depending on whether its a survey or a test:
- The surveys are stored in the Output/Surveys directory.
- The surveys with the users' responses are stored in the Output/SurveysWithAnswers directory.
- The tests are stored in the Output/Tests directory.
- The tests with the users' responses are stored in the Output/TestsWithAnswers directory.
